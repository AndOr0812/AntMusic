#Tip - When is my Miner Too Hot?
As your miner gets hotter it generates more and more errors. Using the BitMain supplied web interface, go into your Kernel Log. Look for messages telling you that it has found 'ret work_id{0xNNNN} don't match task_buffer_match{0xMMMM}.
If you get a lot of these you will loose work and you are probably running too hot. My S5 regularly reports this error, but only on one ASIC (ch1-as29 at the start of the line tells me its ASIC#29 on chain1). When I up the clock speed two more chips start reporting errors. The S5 has 2x30 ASICs (60 in total) and you really don't want to see lots of errors on lots of chips. How many errors you tolerate is up to you but the more this happens the less hashing you get per clock cycle and the shorter the lifespan of the affected ASIC chips.
